# ember-cli-localstorage-adapter-polymorphic

This project adds support for embedded polymorphic records when using ember-cli-localstorage-adapter or compatible versions of ember-localstorage-adapter. ember-cli-localstorage-adapter is recommended.

You can simply use the adapter and serializer as-is in your own Ember app.
